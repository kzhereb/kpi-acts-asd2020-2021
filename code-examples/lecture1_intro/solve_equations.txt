Doctests for solve_equations.py

To run:
  python -m doctest solve_equations.txt
  python -m doctest -v solve_equations.txt

Example 1: solving linear equations  
  
>>> from solve_equations import solve_linear
>>> solve_linear(2,7)
-3.5
>>> 2*solve_linear(2,7)+7
0.0

Example 2: solving quadratic equations

>>> from solve_equations import solve_quadratic
>>> solve_quadratic(1, -23, 42)
(21.0, 2.0)

Check for discriminant < 0

>>> solve_quadratic(1, 0, 1)
'No real roots'

Example 3: numeric solution using Newton method

>>> from solve_equations import solve_approximate
>>> solve_approximate(1,-23,42)
2.0
